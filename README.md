# Competitive Programming (CP) Solutions Repository

Welcome to my **Competitive Programming Solutions Repository**! This repository contains my solutions to various CP problems, showcasing my journey to enhance problem-solving skills, participate in coding contests, and master algorithms and data structures.

---

## 📚 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on problem categories or topics for easy navigation. Here’s the structure:

```
├── Implementation
├── Greedy
├── DynamicProgramming
├── Graphs
├── Math
├── Strings
├── Sorting
└── Miscellaneous
```

Each folder contains solutions to problems relevant to that category, named as:

`<ProblemName>.extension` (e.g., `MaximumSubarray.cpp`, `Dijkstra.py`)
